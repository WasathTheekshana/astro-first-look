# About Sndwch

The history of Sndwch is a long and storied one. It all started in 2017 when a group of friends decided to make a game for the [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) game jam. The game was called "Sndwch" and it was a game about making sandwiches. The game was a hit and the team decided to continue working on it. The game was released on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1008830/Sndwch/) in 2019 and has been a hit ever since.

At Sndwch we believe in making games that are fun to play and easy to learn. We also believe in making games that are accessible to everyone.
